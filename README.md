Project Title:Decentralized Healthcare dApp Interface

Project Description:This project is the frontend interface of a decentralized healthcare application (dApp) designed to interact with a blockchain-based smart contract. Built using React.js and Web3.js (or Ethers.js), the app allows users to seamlessly access and manage Electronic Health Records (EHRs) in a secure and decentralized environment.

The dApp connects to an Ethereum-compatible blockchain network, enabling functionalities such as:

Viewing and updating patient health records

Granting and revoking access to doctors or hospitals

Secure, tamper-proof storage of sensitive health data

Interacting with smart contracts deployed on the blockchain

Project Vision:To revolutionize healthcare data management by creating a secure, transparent, and decentralized platform that empowers patients with full control over their electronic health records (EHRs), while ensuring trusted and permissioned access for medical professionals using blockchain technology.

Key features: Decentralized Health Records (EHRs):
Store and access medical records securely on the blockchain, eliminating single points of failure.

Patient Data Ownership:
Patients have full control over their health data — they decide who can access or update their records.

Permission Management:
Grant or revoke access to doctors, hospitals, or institutions with just a few clicks.

Tamper-Proof History:
Immutable records ensure that no one can alter or delete medical history without authorization.

Web3 Wallet Integration:
Connect and authenticate users using MetaMask or other Ethereum-compatible wallets.
Future Scope:Future Scope
Cross-Hospital & Cross-Border Record Sharing:
Enable seamless sharing of EHRs across different hospitals, states, or countries while maintaining privacy and compliance with local regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR).

NFT-Based Medical Records:
Convert health records into non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to enhance traceability, authenticity, and ownership tracking.

Integration with IoT and Wearables:
Sync real-time health data from devices like fitness trackers, smartwatches, and medical sensors directly into a patient’s blockchain profile.

AI & Analytics Integration:
Use anonymized data stored off-chain for AI-driven insights, predictive diagnostics, and personalized treatment recommendations.

Mobile App Development:
Expand the platform with a dedicated mobile application for easier access and real-time notifications.

Multi-Chain Support:
Extend support to other blockchains (e.g., Polygon, Solana, Avalanche) to reduce transaction costs and improve scalability.

Decentralized Identity (DID) Integration:
Implement DID for verifiable digital identities, making it easier to authenticate patients and medical staff securely.

Insurance & Billing Integration:
Automate claim verification and payments using smart contracts to streamline medical billing and reduce fraud.

Community Health Portals:
Introduce public dashboards for government and NGOs to monitor health trends (with user-consented, anonymized data).
